## Is Subsequent (Easy)
Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if `s` is a subsequence of `t`, or `false` otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string formed from the original string by deleting some (or none) of the characters without changing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"` while `"aec"` is not).

### Example 1:
> **Input:** s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
>
> **Output:** True

### Example 2:
> **Input:** s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
>
> **Output:** False

### Constraints:
- `0 <= s.length <= 100`
- `0 <= t.length <= 10`<sup>4</sup>
- `s` and `t` consist only of lowercase English letters.
