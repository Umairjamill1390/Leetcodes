## Thought Process
- In Python, lists can be concatenated using the addition operator (`+`), which combines two lists into one.
- For this problem, I chose to concatenate the `nums` list with itself by using `nums + nums`, which effectively duplicates the list.
- Another valid approach would be to multiply the list by 2 `(nums * 2)`, which would also duplicate the elements.


```python
class Solution:
    def getConcatenation(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        return nums + nums
```
